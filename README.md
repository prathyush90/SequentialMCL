# SequentialMCL

This project tries to estimate the state vector of redball w.r.t blue ball ground truth. The state vector can be expressed as [x, y, orientation]T .This can be applied for three dimensional case also.Blue ball can be moved with up,right,left and w keys w will add random direction to the blue ball. The particles will still  able to localize themselves even with randomness.

This project is built with inspiration from the following lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3muh7tAlV2Q
